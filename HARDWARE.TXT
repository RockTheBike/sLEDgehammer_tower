start with a single sLEDgehammer wired as normal

modifications to a standard single sLEDgehammer:

C9 - install a 100μF capacitor here (observe polarity)
R6 - install a 36.5KΩ resistor here (stands vertically unlike other resistors)
IC2 - installl a current sensor here
cut wire junction across D4 (joining VCC and VDD nodes)
white wire from difficulty knob should NOT go to VDD.  VCC is correct,
or it can go to the + hole of the ROI+GG row of six holes

note: the following two parts share the nearby GND hole
big 3 watt 2.7Ω resistor from VCC to VDD
2200μF 10V capacitor from VCC to ground (observe polarity)

make sure the pedal-power inputs (2X 4-pole MEGA neutrik jacks) go through
relays to the PLUSOUT terminal on the board

the ultracapaitor bank plus, and the plus to the sLEDgehammer 8-pole connector,
and the plus wire to the buck converter (which makes 5V for the LED displays),
which connects to the PLUSRAIL terminal on the board

RESET_ENERGY_PIN        A5 // a button shorts this to ground to clear energy count
POWER_STRIP_PIN 11 // blue data wire for addressible LEDs on Power Tower (54 pixels long)
DISPLAY0_PIN    12 // green data wire for five-digit number display (8 * 45 pixels, see code)

wiring to round connectors for "power tower" and 5-digit sign (addressible LEDs):
pins 1,2: WHITE wire, +5V (from a separate 5V buck coverter for higher current)
pin 3: GREEN wire, addressible LED data
pins 4,5: BLACK wire, ground
