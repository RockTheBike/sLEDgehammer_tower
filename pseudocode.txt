For the fuzzy fuzzy got it sequence...

While (in the random hoop part of the supplemental power routine i.e. don't
eliminate the other 2 sequences you coded){

Pick a random hoop

Create a variable staticFuzzpercentage which starts small, at 5%

For a period of 1000ms, make staticFuzzPercentage go up from 5 to 100 {
Use staticFuzzPercentage and a randomizer to decide if the light is on or
off. Whatever the answer, do that for 10ms
repeat
}

For the next 1500 ms, turn the same hoop to ON;

Turn the hoop off.
Wait 1000ms.
Repeat from the top of the while loop.

}

I would also like to request that you do the testing on your 2nd box. Nio
doesn't want to drop what he's doing. Hopefully it won't be too much more
time than what you've already done. Use the testing rig and a smart LED
strip please. Test both smart LED outputs, the relay, the sLEDgehammer
functionality, and the knob and reset behavior. Then ask Brittany to help
you get it to Boston by Friday. Thanks a lot.
